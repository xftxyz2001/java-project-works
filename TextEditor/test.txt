Description: Make a simple notepad style editor that the user can use to create, open and edit simple text based files. Provide functionality found in your typical editor including saving, copy/paste and printing capability. Tips: Start with something simple and work your way up. Create the application to first be able to open a window that will allow the user to type into it and save. This window may contain a multiline textbox or textarea (if you are doing a web app), a toolbar and a status bar. Think about how you would read the file into this new window and write it back out. Once you have the basics of reading in and writing out done, you will be able to then do your saving and opening dialogs and from there to copy/paste and printing. Think about how your editor may react if someone tries to open a file which is not text based. Added Difficulty: Add in formatting options like bolding, italics and underline. You can also add in a tabbed interface that will allow the user to open multiple text documents at the same time and edit them individually.
